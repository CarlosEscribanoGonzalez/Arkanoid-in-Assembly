# Arkanoid in Assembly

This is my version of **Arkanoid** implemented in **Assembly language**, using **MARS MIPS**, for the course **Graphic Architectures** during my second year of university.

### About the Project

The objective of this assignment was to understand how programming languages work at a much lower level by creating a simple game in assembly language. This project provided me with insights into low-level programming concepts and the intricacies of game development in assembly.

### Features
- Implementation of Arkanoid in Assembly language.
- Developed using MARS MIPS.
- Designed to demonstrate low-level programming concepts.

### Technologies
- **Assembly Language**
- **MARS MIPS**
